<!-- # Example app with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui)

This example features how to use [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app.

We are connecting the Next.js `_app.js` with `chakra-ui`'s Theme and ColorMode containers so the pages can have app-wide dark/light mode. We are also creating some components which shows the usage of `chakra-ui`'s style props.

## Notes

Chakra has supported Gradients and RTL in `v1.1`. To utilize RTL, [add RTL direction and swap](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/rtl-support).

If you don't have multi-direction app, you should make `<Html lang="ar" dir="rtl">` inside `_document.js`. -->

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
